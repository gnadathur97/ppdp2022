%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
A logic is presented for reasoning about specifications encoded in the
Edinburgh Logical Framework or LF. In this logic, typing judgments in
LF serve as atomic formulas and quantification is permitted over LF
terms and LF contexts. Quantifiers of the first variety are qualified
by simple types that describe the functional structure associated with
the variables they bind. Quantifiers over contexts are typed by
context schemas that constrain their instantiations to adhere to a
regular structure. The semantics of the logic is based ultimately on
an understanding of derivability in LF. As such, valid formulas in the
logic represent meta-theoretic properties of object systems that are
encoded via LF signatures. The logic is complemented by a collection
of proof rules that are sound with respect to the semantics. These
rules come in two forms. One collection of rules captures the meanings
of logical connectives and quantifiers. Another collection provides
a means for analyzing atomic formulas based on an understanding of
derivability in LF; these rules build in the capability for a
case-analysis style reasoning about LF judgements and for induction
over the heights of LF derivations. The logic has been implemented in
the Adelfa proof assistant.
